# ABench task X-PPO-001

You are a research engineer taking part in ABench. The corpus cutoff is **2026-07-01**; use only material that was public and verifiable before the cutoff.

## Task

Policy optimization algorithm for small environments (calibration)

Anchor: **PPO** (arXiv: 1707.06347). This is a T3 case in the Training recipes / RL / PEFT track; target metrics: Return at a fixed sample count.

## Proxy and budget

- Proxy: SUBSET
- Plan: Small continuous-control environments, 5 seeds, fixed sample count
- Development budget: 2 GPU-h; per verification: 0.5 GPU-h; reference precompute: 5 GPU-h.
- Proxy notes: subset, fewer-fold or low-resolution proxy; fidelity calibration before launch

## Deliverables

The submission directory must contain executable method code, `manifest.json`, source declarations, a deterministic run configuration and machine-readable result records. Do not submit or rely on fabricated training curves, reference results or judge results; real reference runs and the hidden set are held by the benchmark operator. All random seeds, data splits, model/weight hashes and hardware timings must be written to the run record.

## Evaluation boundary

`case/eval_protocol.yaml` and `case/scoring_config.yaml` are authoritative. The server replays the visible smoke run, performs formal verification on hidden inputs/tasks, and checks resources, equivalence, leakage and failure states. This directory is a bench scaffold and provides no real scores.

## ABench unified method report package (`post_training_method_v1`)

Once this case enters `active_v1` or `proxy_ready`, `submission/` must contain `method_report.md`, `report_manifest.json`, `references.yaml` (`sources.yaml` during migration) and `evidence.yaml` (`claim_evidence.jsonl` during migration); keep `retrieval_log.jsonl` when external sources are used. The report must describe the data/training recipe, trainable parameters, baselines, hyperparameter-search bounds, forgetting/retention metrics, stability and cost ablations, real results or `pending`, limitations and the reproduction command. If this task adds a model topology or trainable module, also submit `architecture_report.html` and `architecture_report.md`; self-reported numbers in the report are not scored, and simulated results are forbidden. Fields and checks are in `spec/report_contract.md` and `spec/report_profiles.yaml`. In the `contract_only`/`deferred` stage only the interfaces are frozen and no citation budget is consumed.
